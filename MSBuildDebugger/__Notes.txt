- Known Issues
  - stepping is done twice for empty elements
  - F10 doesnt work
  - Shift-F11 doesnt work
  - Cannot close project or files
  - slightly random F9 behavior
  - Stepping behavior random when Batching next with same named tasks
  - Not clean exit

============ TODO for v1 =================
- Decide on Ctrl+F
- Verify that VS dependency has not been taken

============ v2 ====================
- Re-org code
  - Classify DBG operation modes
- Command Line 
- New shell
  - Get closer to the VS debugger UI
  - Nautilus shell may not be hostable on codeplex
  - if not, create a wpf shell at least
- AD7 wrapper
- data break points
- RW properties window
- think about multiproc
- perf
- Analyzer
  - Imports view
  - executable nodes view
- Properties and Items
  - Highlight changed stuff


================================ SCRATCH ===========================================

v1:
- Features:
  - File Open View
  - Output Window
  - Breakpoints
  - Evaluated Properties, Evaluated Items, global properties, environment properties - changes first in red
  - Launch custom targets
  - F5, F11 behavior
  - Visually show current point of execution
  - 
- Verification:
  - Needs to work with all OOB VS projects
  - Needs to work with most of devdiv projects

- wont work
  - conditional overriding of targets
  - multiple tasks of same type in a given target

- vNext:
  - F10 support

- Need to understand distributed logger
- Consider launching msbuild under CLR debugger



==============================================================================


- call stack
  - move line/col detection to call stack calc
  - reuse tos in LocateExecution point
  - goto arbit frame
    - disable properties window and others
    - jump to location
    - set curson in call stack window
  - goto execution frame
    - enable property window and others
    - jump to location
    - set curson in call stack window
  - enhanced trace stack

- F9
  - select in different color
  - revert back old highlighting

- toolbar

- put break point on Project element


- Code Sync
  - Start and end are treated as same for empty elements
  - multiple tasks issue

- before release
  - code sync
    - Start and end are treated as same for empty elements
    - multiple tasks issue
    - task batching
    - target batching
  - set break points
  - prop, item, windows


======================================== TODAY =================================
- move engine related stuff like launching to engine
v implement break into build
- write tests for pdb.create 
- modify XML parser to get project locations as well
- put project in call stack
  - bp binding - set to project if target not found
  - enumeration logic
- Start and end locations for elements
v set BP
  v implement F9 behavior
  v break point window
  v double clicking takes you into bp location
  v debugger needs to honor it
  - Known issues:
    - cannot delete bp
    - slightly random set bp behavior
- ensure devdiv build works
- properties/items window
v better icons
v running from razzle







=========== Stepping Behavior ==============
- Confirm taskid incremented for inactive tasks as well
- No context changes
  - no batching
    - no inactive tasks
    - inactive tasks
  - batching 
    - no inactive tasks
    - inactive tasks
    - batching with same name tasks
    - batching with same name inactive tasks
- Context changes
