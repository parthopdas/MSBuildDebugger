I had written this [way back in 2007](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/parthopdas/2007/12/01/visual-debugger-for-msbuild-projects/) in a flash of inspiraton during a team outing. Publishing this on github as a few folks have asked me for it.

Of course since then the MSBuild team has added first class debugging support in Visual Studio using a clever combination of dynamic IL emission + VS Debugger extensibility. Read all about it [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2010/07/06/debugging-msbuild-script-with-visual-studio/).

In the unlikely event that you find if you find it useful, please feel free to fork, copy, paste, etc.
